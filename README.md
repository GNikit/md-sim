## Description
A program written to investigate the transition of a fluid from MD to SPH. The C++ files **MD.cpp** and **MD.h** contain the core of the fluid simulation while **FileLoadingPlotting.py** contains the analysis methods. The files **Source.cpp** and **Run.py** are used to execute the fluid simulation and the fluid analysis, repsectively.

## Getting Started
Build the library and the test cases with:
```
make -j
```
The current configuration uses the Intel* compilers for C++, change the **Makefile.variables** to suit your compiler and compiler flags.


### Run
Code to run the program with an xml script can be found in **src/Source.cpp** and should be executed by:
```
./bin/md schemas/input_schema.xml
// ^--executable    ^-- input variables
```
Code without the use of the xml parser can be found in the **examples** directory.

### Use libmd in your project
A minimal working example of how to use the **libmd.a** is shown below, make sure to link and include the static library and the header file **MD.h** to your program.

```
#include "MD.h"

int main() {
  int steps = 5000;   // number of iterations
  double a = 0.75;    // softness parameter
  int n = 6;          // potential strength
  double rho = 0.5;   // fluid density
  double t = 0.5;     // fluid temperature
  // Files will be saved to
  std::string dir = "/Desired/Path/"; // The directory has to exist
  
  MD run(dir, steps);
  run.Simulation(rho, t, n, a);
}
```
