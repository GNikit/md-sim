## Description
A program written to investigate the transition of a fluid from MD to SPH. The C++ files **MD.cpp** and **MD.h** contain the core of the fluid simulation while **FileLoadingPlotting.py** contains the analysis methods. The files **Source.cpp** and **Run.py** are used to execute the fluid simulation and the fluid analysis, repsectively.

## Getting Started
Download, **MD.cpp, MD.h, FileLoadingPlotting.py** and **Run.py**. **Source.cpp**, provides insight on how the simulation is supposed to be run.

### Path
* Change *path* in the constructor of **MD** to choose where the files will be saved.

* Chose that same *path* in the **Run.py**

### Run
Code to run the program can be found in **Source.cpp**. The example above, demonstrates the basic idea.

```
#include "MD.h"

int main()
{
  int steps = 5000; 	// number of steps
  float A = 0.75; 	// softness parameter
  int n = 6;  	// potential strength
  int density = 0.5 	// fluid density
  std::string dir = "/Desired/Path/"; // existing directory for file export
  
  MD run(dir, density, steps);
  run.Simulation(n, A);

  return 0;
}
```



## Components
The simulation is comprosed by the following:
* master: Fluid in a Non-Isothermal container

* Isothermal: Fluid in an Isothermal container

* Force_Interaction: A constant force in the x-direction is applied to the particle that is closest to the centre of the box

* Particle_Tracking: Writes the x,y,z position and velovities of all the particles for all the steps. Used in a combination with Python file **particles plot.py**

* Force_Interaction_Particle_Tracking: a combination of the ***Force_Interaction*** and ***Particle_Tracking*** branches
