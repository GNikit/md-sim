1. Runing 'project' from any other directory except /bin results 
   the Python script not being executed due tothe incorrect path '../data/MBDistribution.py'
   that is supplied in the C++ code. The fix should include getting the CWD 
   (the dir from where 'project' is called, should include some dynamic voodoo)

2. In the currect Makefile setup the example binaries cannot be created 
   unless 'make all' is called, which is slightly counter intuitive.
   Examples should be compiled in a seperate make option on the top makefile.
   (On a side note, the current makefile structure is terrible.)

3. The LoadTxt method from the library, will also fail for the same reason
   that is listed in  (1).
